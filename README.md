In this project we connected a not motorized treadmill to a web page that displays different videos like in TikTok app.
The speed from the treadmill retrieved from an arduino esp32 is sent to a supabase real time database and then is retroeved from the web page and it's used to change the scrolling speed of the videos.
The index.html works for big screens if you want to adapted to pc screen just change the vw of the boxes.
